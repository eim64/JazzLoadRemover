# AutoSplitter and Load Remover for Jazzpunk

Resources/Assembly-Csharp.dll si the modified dll
feel free to add more events for the autosplitter, then you just have to set LoadRemover.SplitState to some value, and add some enum to ComponentSettings.SplitterEvent (which is also found in the modified assembly)

All the changes (decompiled) can be found in Assembly-CSharp Differences.
