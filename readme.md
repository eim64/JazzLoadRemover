# AutoSplitter and Load Remover for Jazzpunk

Resources/Assembly-Csharp.dll si the modified dll
feel free to add more events for the autosplitter, then you just have to set LoadRemover.SplitState to some value, and add some enum to ComponentSettings.SplitterEvent (which is also found in the modified assembly)
will make some sort of system for compiling together all changes from some file so that it's easier to edit the assembly and also keep track of what's been changed
